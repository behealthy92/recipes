## Instructions

1. Combine solids: Add the frozen triple berry blend, frozen banana chunks, and
   Greek yogurt to a high-speed blender.
2. Add liquid: Pour in the milk, starting with 1/4 cup. If using an optional
   sweetener, add it now.
3. Blend: Secure the lid and start blending on a low setting. Gradually increase
   the speed.
4. Scrape and adjust: Stop the blender and use a tamper (if available) or scrape
   down the sides with a spatula to push the frozen ingredients toward the
   blades.
5. Achieve consistency: If the mixture is too thick and the blades are stalling,
   add the remaining 1/4 cup of milk, one tablespoon at a time, until the
   smoothie is moving freely and smooth. The goal is a thick, ice-cream-like
   consistency.
6. Serve: Pour immediately into a glass or bowl. Enjoy!
