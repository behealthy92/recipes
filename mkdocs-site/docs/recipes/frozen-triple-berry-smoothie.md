    Portion the frozen fruit and banana into a freezer bag so it is ready to
    blend.

## Instructions

1. **Load the blender.** Add the frozen berries, frozen banana, and Greek yogurt
   to the blender jar.
2. **Add liquid.** Pour in 1/4 cup milk. Add honey if using.
3. **Blend slowly.** Start on low speed, then increase to high until the mixture
   begins to move.
4. **Scrape and adjust.** Stop the blender, scrape down the sides, and use a
   tamper if available.

   the smoothie is thick but moves freely.
